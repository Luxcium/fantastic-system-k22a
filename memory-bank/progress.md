# Progress Log

## 2025-09-27
- Next.js workspace generated in `web/` via pnpm dlx create-next-app; build approvals fixed through `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` and `pnpm rebuild`.
- Documented web utility baseline roadmap and decision log; awaiting stack preference confirmation before scaffolding Next.js workspace.
- Layer 1 foundation files created (`.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `VERSION`, `scripts/` assets) and `scripts/init.sh` verified for idempotence.
- Layer 2 workspace ergonomics established: VS Code settings, Copilot guardrails, memory-bank triad directories, and six context files initialized.
- Layer 3 bootstrap: Confirmed instruction set, added `.prettierignore`, authored `bootstrap-maintainer.chatmode.md`, and created the `bootstrap-audit.prompt.md` card referencing governing instructions.
- Layer 4 automation: Added validator and health scripts, wired VS Code tasks/settings, ingested commit-policy instructions, refreshed prompt cards, and published `memory-bank/index.md`.
- Next: Integrate repo tooling with the new `web/` app (scripts, VS Code tasks), then proceed with layout/navigation scaffolding and CI wiring.
