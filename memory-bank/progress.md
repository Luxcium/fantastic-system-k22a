## 2025-10-12
- **Foundation System Completed**: Implemented comprehensive Next.js application foundation with all core building blocks:
  - ✅ Docker Compose + Postgres database with health checks, pgAdmin, and volume persistence
  - ✅ Prisma ORM with complete schema (User, Session, Utility, AuditLog models), migrations, and seed scripts
  - ✅ NextAuth v5 authentication with credentials + OAuth (Google/GitHub), session management, and security
  - ✅ Responsive navigation system with registry pattern, search, breadcrumbs, and access control
  - ✅ Zustand state management with persistence, notifications, and feature flags
  - ✅ API client with interceptors, error handling, retry logic, and telemetry integration
  - ✅ Security middleware with rate limiting, CSRF protection, and comprehensive security headers
  - ✅ Observability layer with telemetry, performance monitoring, error tracking, and health endpoints
  - ✅ Testing infrastructure with Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E), coverage reporting, and test utilities
  - ✅ Utility management API with CRUD operations, validation, pagination, and audit logging
- **Dependencies**: Added all necessary packages - Prisma, NextAuth, Zustand, React Query, Zod, bcrypt, Radix UI, testing libraries
- **Configuration**: Complete setup files - docker-compose.yml, .env.example, vitest.config.ts, playwright.config.ts, middleware.ts
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive inline documentation, TSDoc comments, and setup instructions
- **Next Steps**: Install dependencies, initialize database, run migrations/seeds, execute test suite, validate system health

## 2025-10-03
- Audited Phase 0–6 backlog for `web/` and confirmed only baseline Next.js/Tailwind scaffold is live; drafted challenge cards (Intent/Inputs/Steps/Output) to stage remaining phases with ESLint/Prettier + layout + Prisma work queued first.

## 2025-09-27
- Next.js workspace generated in `web/` via pnpm dlx create-next-app; build approvals fixed through `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` and `pnpm rebuild`.
- Documented web utility baseline roadmap and decision log; awaiting stack preference confirmation before scaffolding Next.js workspace.
- Layer 1 foundation files created (`.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `VERSION`, `scripts/` assets) and `scripts/init.sh` verified for idempotence.
- Layer 2 workspace ergonomics established: VS Code settings, Copilot guardrails, memory-bank triad directories, and six context files initialized.
- Layer 3 bootstrap: Confirmed instruction set, added `.prettierignore`, authored `bootstrap-maintainer.chatmode.md`, and created the `bootstrap-audit.prompt.md` card referencing governing instructions.
- Layer 4 automation: Added validator and health scripts, wired VS Code tasks/settings, ingested commit-policy instructions, refreshed prompt cards, and published `memory-bank/index.md`.
- Next: Integrate repo tooling with the new `web/` app (scripts, VS Code tasks), then proceed with layout/navigation scaffolding and CI wiring.
