# Active Context

- Current focus: Replace the default landing page with a rich, client-side dashboard experience built in Next.js/TypeScript that mirrors the provided React demo (navigation, role-aware sidebar, charts, tables, authentication mock, theme switching).
- Implementation status: Foundation application and tooling remain intact; new UI work will layer on top of the existing `web/` app without touching backend plumbing yet.
- Immediate next action: Add required UI dependencies (e.g., lucide-react, framer-motion, recharts) and implement the interactive dashboard inside `web/src/app/page.tsx`, keeping the architecture demo-only for now.
- Reference artifacts: web/src/app/page.tsx (to be replaced), web/src/app/layout.tsx (metadata/theme wiring), web/src/app/globals.css (base styling), sample React demo provided in chat for parity.
- Previous milestone: Comprehensive Next.js foundation (Docker/Postgres, Prisma, NextAuth, navigation, testing) is already committed and serves as the baseline for this UI work.
- Notes: Keep code purely frontend mock (no API calls yet) and structure components so later backend wiring can swap in real data.
