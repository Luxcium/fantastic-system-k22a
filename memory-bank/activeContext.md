- Current focus: Next.js workspace scaffolded under `web/`; stabilizing tooling and documenting reproducible setup (pnpm home/store env vars, build approvals).
- Immediate next action: Extend repo tooling (scripts, VS Code tasks, lint/test integration) to target the new app and begin layout/navigation implementation.
- Reference artifacts: `docs/roadmap/alpha-track.md`, `memory-bank/decisions/2025-09-27-web-utility-baseline.md`, `memory-bank/decisions/2025-09-27-nextjs-scaffold.md`.
- Previous milestone: Baseline roadmap and decision log captured for incremental planning.
