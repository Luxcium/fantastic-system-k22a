# Active Context

- Timestamp: 2025-10-31T00:00:00Z
- Current focus: ♻️ Developer experience polish — ensure dev server ergonomics remain cross-platform
- Implementation status:
  - ✅ Replaced hard-coded `/usr/bin/google-chrome` launch with `web/scripts/open-browser.mjs`
  - ✅ Updated `web/package.json` `dev` script to invoke the helper after `wait-on`
  - ✅ Documented browser auto-launch behavior and opt-out instructions in `web/README.md`
- Immediate next action: Monitor feedback from contributors using different OS environments and iterate if additional launchers are required.
- Notes:
  - Helper selects `open` (macOS), `start` (Windows via `cmd`), or `xdg-open` (Linux/BSD) and falls back to manual launch with warnings when unavailable.

  - ✅ Turbopack enabled as default bundler (faster builds)
  - ✅ All 62 tests passing
  - ✅ Build process verified and working
  - ✅ Development server tested and operational
  - ✅ No breaking changes or regressions detected
  - ✅ Screenshot automation system remains fully functional
  - ✅ Documentation updated in memory-bank
- Immediate next action: Continue with dashboard development, NextAuth integration and real data hydration from Prisma-backed APIs.
- Reference artifacts:
  - `web/src/utils/screenshot.ts` — Core screenshot utility with full TypeScript support
  - `web/scripts/screenshot.ts` — CLI tool for screenshot capture
  - `web/scripts/screenshot-examples.ts` — Programmatic usage examples
  - `web/docs/SCREENSHOT-AUTOMATION.md` — Comprehensive documentation
  - `memory-bank/index.md` — complete documentation index
  - `memory-bank/reference/` — quick reference guides (biome, quick-reference, setup-checklist, component-architecture)
  - `memory-bank/decisions/` — architectural decisions and summaries (implementation-summary, frontend-optimization-summary, firewall-analysis)
  - `memory-bank/roadmap/` — project roadmaps (alpha-track)
- Previous milestones: Genesis foundation (Docker/Postgres/Prisma/NextAuth) established; Biome migration completed; dashboard UI parity achieved; comprehensive testing infrastructure in place; documentation consolidated; screenshot automation system implemented and tested; **Next.js 16.0.1 and React 19.2.0 upgrade completed**.
- Notes:
  - Next.js 16 brings Turbopack as default bundler for improved build performance
  - React 19.2 includes latest bug fixes and improvements
  - TypeScript configuration now uses "react-jsx" for automatic JSX runtime
  - next-auth shows peer dependency warning but remains fully functional
  - All existing features (screenshot automation, authentication, database) working correctly
- Open questions:
  - Should we monitor next-auth updates for official Next.js 16 support?
  - Are there Next.js 16 specific features we should leverage (explicit caching, etc.)?
