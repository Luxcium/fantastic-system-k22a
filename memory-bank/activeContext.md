- Current focus: Documentation consolidation complete. All markdown files have been organized into the memory-bank directory structure for better maintainability and discovery.
- Implementation status:
  - All markdown documentation files have been consolidated into `memory-bank/` directory
  - New subdirectories created: `reference/`, `roadmap/` to organize different types of documentation
  - Root directory now contains only `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `LICENSE`, and `VERSION`
  - All internal references updated to reflect new file locations
  - Complete documentation index at `memory-bank/index.md` serves as the gateway to all docs
- Immediate next action: Continue with dashboard development, NextAuth integration and real data hydration from Prisma-backed APIs.
- Reference artifacts:
  - `memory-bank/index.md` — complete documentation index
  - `memory-bank/reference/` — quick reference guides (biome, quick-reference, setup-checklist, component-architecture)
  - `memory-bank/decisions/` — architectural decisions and summaries (implementation-summary, frontend-optimization-summary, firewall-analysis)
  - `memory-bank/roadmap/` — project roadmaps (alpha-track)
- Previous milestones: Genesis foundation (Docker/Postgres/Prisma/NextAuth) established; Biome migration completed; dashboard UI parity achieved; comprehensive testing infrastructure in place; documentation now fully consolidated.
- Notes:
  - Documentation structure now follows memory-bank protocol with clear categorization
  - All files organized into logical subdirectories: reference/, decisions/, roadmap/, instructions/, prompts/, chatmodes/
  - Empty docs/roadmap/ directory remains (Git doesn't track empty directories)
  - All cross-references between documents have been updated
- Open questions:
  - Should we add more categories to memory-bank for future documentation needs?
  - How should we handle documentation that spans multiple categories?
