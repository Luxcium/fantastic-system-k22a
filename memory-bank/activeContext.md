- Current focus: Repository documentation consolidation completed. All markdown files (except README.md and AGENTS.md) have been moved to memory-bank/ for better organization.
- Implementation status:
  - All documentation files successfully moved to `memory-bank/reference/` and `memory-bank/summaries/` subdirectories
  - Complete documentation index available at `memory-bank/index.md`
  - All internal references updated to reflect new file locations
  - Repository structure simplified with only essential files in root
- Completed actions:
  - Created `memory-bank/reference/` directory for quick reference guides (Biome, setup checklist, quick reference, component architecture, firewall analysis)
  - Created `memory-bank/summaries/` directory for implementation summaries
  - Moved DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md to memory-bank/index.md and updated all paths
  - Updated README.md to reference new documentation locations
  - Updated AGENTS.md to reflect new paths
  - Verified all internal references are correct
- Reference artifacts:
  - `memory-bank/index.md` — Complete documentation index (formerly DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md)
  - `memory-bank/reference/` — All quick reference guides and setup documentation
  - `memory-bank/summaries/` — Implementation and optimization summaries
  - Root directory now contains only: README.md, AGENTS.md, LICENSE, VERSION
- Previous milestones: Genesis foundation (Docker/Postgres/Prisma/NextAuth) established; Biome migration completed; dashboard UI parity achieved with synthetic data and animation modules; frontend optimization and testing completed.
- Immediate next action: Backend data integration, NextAuth authentication flow implementation, and continued feature development.
- Notes:
  - Documentation is now more organized and easier to navigate
  - Memory bank protocol followed: all context files updated
  - All links verified to work with new structure
