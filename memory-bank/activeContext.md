# Active Context

- Current focus: Hardening the migrated dashboard frontend so the baseline build/test pipeline is green. PostCSS now loads via explicit ESM imports and date formatting is normalized to UTC to prevent timezone-related flakiness in tests and UI copy.
- Implementation status:
  - Interactive dashboard shell lives in `web/src/app/page.tsx` with mock auth, role-aware routing, charts, and responsive layout mirroring the React reference.
  - Vitest suite (62 specs) passes after stabilizing `formatDate` and `formatRelativeTime` helpers; utilities now avoid `any` types and follow Biome guidance.
  - PostCSS config is ESM-friendly (`tailwindcss()` + `autoprefixer()`) so Vite/Vitest can resolve Tailwind when running under the Node API.
- Immediate next action: Capture responsive (mobile/desktop) previews once the Playwright browser download issue is resolved, then proceed with NextAuth integration and real data hydration from Prisma-backed APIs.
- Reference artifacts:
  - `web/postcss.config.mjs` — explicit plugin imports
  - `web/src/lib/utils.ts` — normalized date helper + lint-friendly utilities
  - `web/src/test/utils.test.ts` & `web/src/test/ui-components.test.tsx` — coverage for helpers and UI
  - `web/src/app/page.tsx` — current dashboard implementation
- Previous milestones: Genesis foundation (Docker/Postgres/Prisma/NextAuth) established; Biome migration completed; dashboard UI parity achieved with synthetic data and animation modules.
- Notes:
  - Dark-mode toggled via `document.documentElement` while awaiting design-token alignment.
  - Google Fonts remain disabled because of workspace network restrictions.
  - Playwright browser installation still blocked, which prevents automated screenshot capture.
- Open questions:
  - Should sign-in hand off to NextAuth routes once backend flows exist?
  - Which telemetry endpoints (or mocked services) will power the charts after backend wiring?
  - What visual validation workflow should replace Playwright screenshots if the sandbox limitation persists?
