# Active Context

- Timestamp: 2025-10-21T01:30:00Z
- Current focus: Completing project setup requirements - adding missing elements (features directory, Husky/lint-staged, .key directory) and comprehensive documentation
- Implementation status:
  - ✅ All core framework dependencies installed and configured (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript)
  - ✅ Database and ORM setup complete (PostgreSQL 16, Prisma 6.17.1)
  - ✅ Authentication configured (NextAuth v5 with multiple providers)
  - ✅ State management ready (Zustand 5.0.8, TanStack Query 5.90.2)
  - ✅ Styling system configured (Tailwind CSS v4, Biome for linting/formatting)
  - ✅ Testing infrastructure complete (Vitest, Playwright)
  - ✅ Docker Compose setup for PostgreSQL and pgAdmin
  - ✅ Created `src/features/` directory for feature-specific code organization
  - ✅ Created `.key/` directory for sensitive key management
  - ✅ Installed and configured Husky (9.1.7) and lint-staged (16.2.5) for Git hooks
  - ✅ Created comprehensive `memory-bank/dependencies.md` tracking all dependencies
  - ✅ Updated `web/README.md` with complete project documentation
  - ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.key/` directory (except README files)
- Immediate next action: Update remaining memory-bank files, verify all configurations, run tests to ensure everything works
- Reference artifacts:
  - `memory-bank/dependencies.md` — comprehensive dependency tracking and update policies
  - `memory-bank/index.md` — complete documentation index
  - `memory-bank/reference/` — quick reference guides
  - `memory-bank/decisions/` — architectural decisions and summaries
  - `memory-bank/roadmap/` — project roadmaps
  - `web/README.md` — complete web application documentation
  - `web/SETUP.md` — detailed setup instructions
- Previous milestones: Genesis foundation (Docker/Postgres/Prisma/NextAuth) established; Biome migration completed; dashboard UI parity achieved; comprehensive testing infrastructure in place; documentation fully consolidated
- Current milestone: Project setup completion with all required elements (directory structure, Git hooks, documentation)
- Notes:
  - Package manager: pnpm 10.18.3 installed and configured
  - Git hooks: Pre-commit hook runs lint-staged to check TypeScript/JavaScript files
  - Directory structure: Added features/ for domain-driven design and .key/ for sensitive key management
  - Documentation: Comprehensive tracking of all dependencies with version rationale
  - All changes follow SOLID principles and maintain backward compatibility
- Open questions:
  - None at this time - all requirements from problem statement addressed
