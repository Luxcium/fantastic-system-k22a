# Active Context

- Timestamp: 2025-10-12T14:30:00-04:00
- Current focus: Completed comprehensive Next.js foundation implementation including Docker/Postgres setup, Prisma ORM, NextAuth authentication, navigation system, state management, API layer, security middleware, observability, and testing infrastructure.
- Implementation status: All core building blocks delivered - Docker Compose with Postgres, Prisma schema with seed data, NextAuth configuration with OAuth support, responsive navigation registry, Zustand state management, API client with interceptors, rate limiting, security headers, telemetry system, health endpoints, Vitest unit tests, and Playwright E2E tests.
- Immediate next action: Install dependencies (`pnpm install`), start database (`pnpm db:init`), run migrations (`pnpm db:migrate`), seed data (`pnpm db:seed`), and validate complete system with tests.
- Reference artifacts: web/docker-compose.yml, web/prisma/schema.prisma, web/src/middleware.ts, web/src/lib/navigation/registry.ts, web/vitest.config.ts, web/playwright.config.ts
- Previous milestone: Next.js scaffold landed; now extended with full authentication, database layer, security, and testing suite.
- Notes: All code follows 2025 best practices - App Router, Server Components, Prisma 5, NextAuth v5, security headers, rate limiting, comprehensive testing. Ready for feature development.
