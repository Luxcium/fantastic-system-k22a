# Active Context

- Timestamp: 2025-10-31T20:45:07Z
- Current focus: Enforce the documented Node.js 22+ baseline in setup verification
- Implementation status:
  - ✅ Updated `web/scripts/verify-setup.sh` so Node.js majors below 22 fail and newer majors emit a cautionary warning
  - ✅ Confirmed the script passes the Node.js check when running `pnpm verify` with Node v22.21.1
- Immediate next action: Monitor future automation tasks that rely on the setup script now that the runtime requirement is enforced
- Project Status: ✅ Setup verification aligned with tech context requirements

- Timestamp: 2025-10-21T01:40:00Z

  - ✅ Git hooks: Working (pre-commit with lint-staged)
- Open questions:
  - None - all requirements from problem statement addressed and verified
- Timestamp: 2025-10-30T19:59:00+00:00
- Current focus: ✅ Firewall configuration complete - All external service connections disabled for restricted environments
- Implementation status:
  - ✅ Next.js upgraded from 15.5.4 to 16.0.1 (latest stable)
  - ✅ Firewall blocking issues resolved for Chromium and Prisma services
  - ✅ Environment variables configured to disable telemetry and update checks
  - ✅ Browser launch options enhanced with connectivity-blocking flags
  - ✅ Documentation created for firewall configuration and CI/CD usage
  - ✅ React upgraded from 19.1.0 to 19.2.0 (latest stable)
  - ✅ React-DOM upgraded from 19.1.0 to 19.2.0 (latest stable)
  - ✅ TypeScript configuration updated for React automatic JSX runtime
  - ✅ Turbopack enabled as default bundler (faster builds)
  - ✅ All 62 tests passing
  - ✅ Build process verified and working
  - ✅ Development server tested and operational
  - ✅ No breaking changes or regressions detected
  - ✅ Screenshot automation system remains fully functional
  - ✅ Documentation updated in memory-bank
- Immediate next action: Continue with dashboard development, NextAuth integration and real data hydration from Prisma-backed APIs.
- Reference artifacts:
  - `web/src/utils/screenshot.ts` — Core screenshot utility with full TypeScript support
  - `web/scripts/screenshot.ts` — CLI tool for screenshot capture
  - `web/scripts/screenshot-examples.ts` — Programmatic usage examples
  - `web/docs/SCREENSHOT-AUTOMATION.md` — Comprehensive documentation
  - `memory-bank/index.md` — complete documentation index
  - `memory-bank/reference/` — quick reference guides (biome, quick-reference, setup-checklist, component-architecture)
  - `memory-bank/decisions/` — architectural decisions and summaries (implementation-summary, frontend-optimization-summary, firewall-analysis)
  - `memory-bank/roadmap/` — project roadmaps (alpha-track)
- Previous milestones: Genesis foundation (Docker/Postgres/Prisma/NextAuth) established; Biome migration completed; dashboard UI parity achieved; comprehensive testing infrastructure in place; documentation consolidated; screenshot automation system implemented and tested; **Next.js 16.0.1 and React 19.2.0 upgrade completed**.
- Notes:
  - Next.js 16 brings Turbopack as default bundler for improved build performance
  - React 19.2 includes latest bug fixes and improvements
  - TypeScript configuration now uses "react-jsx" for automatic JSX runtime
  - next-auth shows peer dependency warning but remains fully functional
  - All existing features (screenshot automation, authentication, database) working correctly
- Open questions:
  - Should we monitor next-auth updates for official Next.js 16 support?
  - Are there Next.js 16 specific features we should leverage (explicit caching, etc.)?
