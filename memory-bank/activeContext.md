- Current focus: Screenshot automation system implemented and tested. Comprehensive tooling for capturing screenshots in agentic workflows now available.
- Implementation status:
  - ✅ Screenshot automation system fully implemented with TypeScript utility, CLI tool, and documentation
  - ✅ Support for multiple viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop, desktop-HD) with light/dark theme switching
  - ✅ System browser detection working with Chromium/Chrome across platforms
  - ✅ Tested successfully: 6 screenshots captured (mobile/tablet/desktop × light/dark) in ~7 seconds
  - ✅ npm scripts added: `screenshot`, `screenshot:suite`, `screenshot:mobile/tablet/desktop`
  - ✅ Documentation created at `web/docs/SCREENSHOT-AUTOMATION.md`
- Immediate next action: Continue with dashboard development, NextAuth integration and real data hydration from Prisma-backed APIs.
- Reference artifacts:
  - `web/src/utils/screenshot.ts` — Core screenshot utility with full TypeScript support
  - `web/scripts/screenshot.ts` — CLI tool for screenshot capture
  - `web/scripts/screenshot-examples.ts` — Programmatic usage examples
  - `web/docs/SCREENSHOT-AUTOMATION.md` — Comprehensive documentation
  - `memory-bank/index.md` — complete documentation index
  - `memory-bank/reference/` — quick reference guides (biome, quick-reference, setup-checklist, component-architecture)
  - `memory-bank/decisions/` — architectural decisions and summaries (implementation-summary, frontend-optimization-summary, firewall-analysis)
  - `memory-bank/roadmap/` — project roadmaps (alpha-track)
- Previous milestones: Genesis foundation (Docker/Postgres/Prisma/NextAuth) established; Biome migration completed; dashboard UI parity achieved; comprehensive testing infrastructure in place; documentation consolidated; **screenshot automation system implemented and tested**.
- Notes:
  - Screenshot system uses Playwright with system browser for resilience
  - Supports headless and headed modes for debugging
  - Full-page screenshots, element waiting, and custom viewports supported
  - Suitable for CI/CD pipelines, visual regression testing, and agentic workflows
- Open questions:
  - Should we integrate screenshot capture into CI/CD pipeline?
  - Would visual regression testing be valuable for this project?
