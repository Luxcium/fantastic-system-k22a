- Current focus: Successfully migrated from ESLint/Prettier to Biome as the modern linter and formatter for the project.
- Immediate next action: Documentation complete; Biome 2.2.0 fully configured and tested. Ready for development with modern tooling.
- Reference artifacts: `memory-bank/instructions/biome-linting-formatting.instructions.md`, `web/biome.json`, `.vscode/settings.json`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Previous milestone: Next.js workspace scaffolded; now enhanced with Biome tooling for superior linting and formatting performance.
- Timestamp: 2025-10-19T02:55:00-04:00
- Current focus: Frontend optimization completed with modular components, comprehensive testing, and security validation. Dashboard shell refactored into reusable UI components with complete TSDoc documentation.
- Implementation status: 
  - All TypeScript errors resolved
  - Build configuration fixed (PostCSS, Tailwind, font dependencies)
  - UI components extracted to `/src/components/ui/` (Button, Badge, Avatar, Card, CardHeader)
  - Comprehensive test suite: 62 unit tests with 100% pass rate
  - Utility functions: 42 tests, 96.96% coverage
  - UI components: 20 tests, full component coverage
  - CodeQL security scan: 0 vulnerabilities
  - All components documented with TSDoc
  - Type-safe with full TypeScript compliance
- Immediate next action: Backend integration for real data, NextAuth integration for authentication, E2E testing once Playwright browser installation issues resolved
- Reference artifacts:
  - `web/src/components/ui/` - Modular UI components
  - `web/src/test/utils.test.ts` - Utility function tests
  - `web/src/test/ui-components.test.tsx` - Component tests
  - `web/src/app/page.tsx` - Main dashboard with TSDoc
  - `web/vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration
- Previous milestone: Comprehensive Next.js foundation (Docker/Postgres, Prisma, NextAuth, navigation, testing) established
- Notes: 
  - Dark-mode handling via `document.documentElement` class toggle
  - Google Fonts removed due to network restrictions
  - E2E screenshots blocked by Playwright installation issues in sandbox
  - All code follows SOLID principles and is highly modular and reusable
- Open questions: 
  - Should sign-in flow delegate to NextAuth routes instead of mock authentication?
  - What telemetry endpoints will power charts once backend is ready?
  - Mobile/desktop responsive design validation needs visual screenshots when Playwright resolved
