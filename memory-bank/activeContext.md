# Active Context

- Timestamp: 2025-10-03T00:24:20-04:00
- Current focus: Audited Phase 0â€“6 readiness for the `web/` Next.js workspace and drafted challenge cards to stage missing scaffolding, tooling, and data plumbing.
- Immediate next action: Sequence Phase 0/1 backlog execution (ESLint/Prettier alignment, layout scaffold) and coordinate Prisma + database decisions per issued challenge cards.
- Reference artifacts: docs/roadmap/alpha-track.md, memory-bank/decisions/2025-09-27-web-utility-baseline.md, memory-bank/decisions/2025-09-27-nextjs-scaffold.md.
- Previous milestone: Next.js scaffold landed with automation/validators; awaiting feature-level implementation.
- Notes: Challenge card plan (2025-10-03) is now source of truth for agent prompts; create `memory-bank/dependencies.md` when dependency analysis begins.
