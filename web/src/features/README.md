# Features Directory

This directory contains feature-specific code organized by domain.

Each feature should contain:

- Components specific to that feature
- Hooks and utilities for the feature
- Types and interfaces
- API routes or data fetching logic

Follow the SOLID principles and keep features modular and independent.
